## Postman

We will be using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for API testing and development. Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.

To get started, download Postman from their [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

After installing Postman, you can join our workspace by clicking on this [invitation link](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=c483200ead2a17313c9a0f4e8199423e).
